    "\n",
    "This study presents an analysis of cardiopulmonary diseases and their associated symptoms using a Bayesian network. The network models the probabilistic relationships between smoking, various health conditions such as heart disease, lung cancer, and symptoms associated with COVID-19. The analysis demonstrates the impact of smoking on the likelihood of developing these conditions and extends to case studies of COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptom analysis. The results, derived from conditional probability tables, highlight the use of Bayesian networks as a powerful tool for medical diagnosis and decision-making.\n",

    "<p><h4> <b>2. Introduction</b> </h4></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiopulmonary diseases and COVID-19 are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Smoking is a significant risk factor for cardiopulmonary diseases, while COVID-19 presents a complex set of symptoms that overlap with other respiratory illnesses like the flu and pneumonia. Understanding the relationships between smoking, heart disease, lung cancer, and COVID-19 symptoms is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment. Bayesian networks offer a probabilistic framework to model these relationships, allowing for the integration of uncertainty and the prediction of outcomes based on observed evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study employs a Bayesian network to model the relationships between smoking, heart disease, lung cancer, and COVID-19 symptoms. The network structure is designed based on clinical knowledge, and the conditional probabilities are derived from existing medical data. Through this model, we aim to quantify the impact of smoking on various health outcomes and extend the model to COVID-19 diagnosis, providing a tool for medical decision-making.\n",

    "**3.1 Bayesian Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bayesian network is a graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node in the graph represents a variable, and the edges denote the conditional dependencies between these variables. The strength of these dependencies is quantified using conditional probability tables (CPTs).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core Principle**: Bayesian networks rely on Bayes' Theorem, which allows for the computation of the posterior probability of a hypothesis given observed evidence. In the context of medical diagnosis, Bayesian networks can update the probability of a disease given the presence of symptoms or risk factors, such as smoking or COVID-19. (Jensen, F. V., 1996) (Korb, K. B., & Nicholson, A. E. , 2010) (Pearl, J., 1988)\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for updating the probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(H∣E)= \\frac{P(E∣H)⋅P(H)}{P(E)}$$\n",
    "​\t\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $P(H∣E)$ is the posterior probability of the hypothesis $H$ (e.g., presence of disease) given evidence $E$ (e.g., symptoms).\n",
    "- $P(E∣H)$ is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.\n",
    "- $P(H)$ is the prior probability of the hypothesis.\n",
    "- $P(E)$ is the marginal probability of the evidence.\n",

    "**4.1 Probabilities and Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian network is constructed using the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smoking (Fumar)**: Indicates whether the individual smokes.\n",
    "2. **Heart Disease (Corazón)**: Indicates the presence of heart disease.\n",
    "3. **Lung Cancer (Cáncer Pulmón)**: Indicates the presence of lung cancer.\n",
    "4. **Cough (Tos)**: Indicates whether the individual has a cough.\n",
    "5. **Fatigue (Cansancio)**: Indicates whether the individual experiences fatigue.\n",
    "6. **Tachycardia (Taquicardia)**: Indicates whether the individual has tachycardia.\n",
    "7. **COVID-19 Symptoms**: Includes symptoms such as fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing, and loss of taste or smell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional probabilities for these variables are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P(Fumar)**: The probability of smoking.\n",
    "- **P(Corazón | Fumar)**: The probability of heart disease given the smoking status.\n",
    "- **P(Cáncer Pulmón | Fumar)**: The probability of lung cancer given the smoking status.\n",
    "- **P(Tos | Fumar, Cáncer Pulmón)**: The probability of cough given smoking status and lung cancer.\n",
    "- **P(Cansancio | Corazón, Cáncer Pulmón)**: The probability of fatigue given heart disease and lung cancer.\n",
    "- **P(Taquicardia | Corazón)**: The probability of tachycardia given heart disease.\n",

    "**4.2 Case Study: COVID-19 Symptom Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Health Organization (WHO) established the criteria to recognize COVID-19 symptoms. In this study, three cases were analyzed where patients' symptoms were recorded to determine whether they had the flu, pneumonia, or COVID-19. The symptoms of each patient were documented, and a Bayesian network was applied to estimate the probability of each disease based on the observed symptoms. This approach allowed for a probabilistic assessment of the likelihood of each condition, providing a quantitative basis for diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific cases analyzed were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Case 1**: The patient presented with a headache, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. Additional tests showed that the patient did not have a fever, dry cough, high fever, speech or mobility impairment, and maintained taste and smell.\n",
    "2. **Case 2**: The patient arrived alone and was unable to speak or move. The symptoms presented included fever, high fever, dry cough, and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms were unknown due to the patient's condition.\n",
    "3. **Case 3**: The patient presented with a mild fever, fatigue, dry cough, and difficulty breathing, without motor impairment or loss of taste or smell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian network was employed to analyze the symptoms presented by these patients and to determine the probability of flu, pneumonia, or COVID-19 based on the symptom profile provided."
